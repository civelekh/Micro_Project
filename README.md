# Micro_Project


How to Run

After opening the project in Deeds and starting the simulation, it is recommended to set the Clock Frequency to around 1 kHz to clearly see the LED animations. The system starts in a locked state. To unlock it, you need to enter the binary password 00000101 on the left processor's (Tx) switches (just toggle the 1st and 3rd switches from the top). Once the correct password is entered, the green LED on the processor will turn on. While the system is unlocked, if you toggle the button switch, you will see the right processor (Rx) interrupt its current animation and start flashing all LEDs like an alarm. Turning the button off returns the system to normal.
